"""
for this exercise we will be creating a game which follows
the following structure:
1) computer: picks random number between 1 and 100 (maybe start with 10)
2) user: guesses a number
3) computer: tells user if their guess was high or low
4) repeats steps 2 and 3 until number is guessed
"""

# import random

# pick a random number

# get the guess from the user

# logic for checking how to respond 
# should be a simple if, elif, else

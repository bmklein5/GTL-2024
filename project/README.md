# Project Title

Directory for TODO by Brady Klein and students from the Margarita Salas school for the 2024 GTL-Spain program at MIT.

## Description

Through my participation in MIT's GTL-Spain program, I had the opportunity to travel to Madrid and teach at the IES Margarita Salas school in Majadahonda for 3 weeks during January 2024. While there, I mainly taught the students introductory Python but also helped in English classes by sharing my experiences growing up and attending university in the U.S.

As the culmination of this experience in this program, I worked on this project with a group of students in order to exhibit the skills I taught them to the [Rafael del Pino Foundation](https://frdelpino.es/en_gb/) which sponsored my participation in the program.
